    <subject>How much are wrong and damaged  I.T. asset returns costing you?</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Are you missing easy revenue by not offering a collection solution for I.T. equipment returns?

If you’re not earning a passive profit by referring your clients to a solution for properly packing and shipping  I.T. equipment returns, you’re missing out --and exposing your clients to possible data security risks. 

By simply referring (or requiring) your customers to use OnePak for return logistics, your company could be earning steady commissions on every  I.T. equipment return, while improving customer satisfaction.

Are you wasting money on resolving claims for missing, mistaken and damaged  I.T. equipment?

Claims resolution is expensive for you and a hassle for your clients.  And almost every claim is a result of not offering your clients a standardized, trackable return logistics solution.

Are you paying additional logistics costs to reroute I.T. assets to their final destination?  

Our goal is to eliminate claims and errors before they occur and to increase your profits by providing you, your client, and your receiving facility with technology-driven onsite asset collection services.  The cost savings for you are tremendous, and your client relationships are preserved without disputes.

Earn more revenue while reducing costs.  It’s that simple. 

Partnering with OnePak as your clients’ return logistics solution is as easy as making a referral and linking your web site to our system.  We’ll take it from there.

Call us to learn more about how quickly and easily you can turn your  I.T. equipment lease returns into profits.  You’re losing money every day that you wait. 

Best regards,

Keri Long
